##### Visualizing the state machine

<CodeSurferColumns themes={COLUMN_THEMES}>

<Step title="#2 State Machine">

```jsx 1:22 file=./samples/MyEditForm-alt2.txt

```

<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.8rem; line-height: 1.25;">

### Advantages

1. Clean
2. Predictable
3. Single place to view/change all the states and transitions
